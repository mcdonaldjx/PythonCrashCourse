#Exercise 11-3- Employee: Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes. Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5,000 to the annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount. Write a test file for Employee with two test functions, test_give_default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Write your tests once without using a fixture, and make sure they both pass. Then write a fixture so you donâ€™t have to create a new employee instance in each test function. Run the tests again, and make sure both tests still pass.
class Employee:
  def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, annual_salary):
    self.first_name = first_name.title()
    self.last_name = last_name.title()
    self.salary = int(annual_salary)
    
  def give_raise(self, bonus=5000):
    self.salary += bonus
