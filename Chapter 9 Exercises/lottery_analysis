#Exercise 9-15- Lottery Analysis: Make a list or tuple called my_ticket. Write a loop that keeps pulling numbers until your ticket wins. Print a message reporting how many times the loop had to run to give you a winning ticket.
from random import choice
characters = ['j','e','k','d','b', 89, 95, 21, 22, 81, 47, 15, 100, 98, 39]
my_ticket = [choice(characters)]
print(f"Starting the lottery. Your ticket is {my_ticket[0]}..")
drawings = 0
while characters:
    winner = choice(characters)
    characters.remove(winner)
    drawings += 1
    print(f"Drew {winner}")
    if winner in my_ticket:
        print(f"\tYou won! It took {drawings} drawings!")
        break
