#Exercise 10-12- Favorite Number Remembered: Combine the two programs you wrote in Exercise 10-11 into one file. If the number is already stored, report the favorite number to the user. If not, prompt for the userâ€™s favorite number and store it in a file. Run the program twice to see that it works.
